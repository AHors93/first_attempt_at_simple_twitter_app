Very basic attempt at recreating "Twitter" - I haven't added that much complexity but it's been good practice at a simple React Application - moving away from vanilla JS


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
